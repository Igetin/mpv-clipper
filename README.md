# HACK

This is a quick & dirty hack of [ekisu’s mpv-webm][mpv-webm] that adds an option for selecting an encoding profile. All profiles starting with `enc-` are considered encoding profiles. CRF can be changed independently and overrides any CRF setting in profile. All other options have been removed.

Has basic support for HLS network streams, including livestreams. Not tested extensively for livestreams, but it should mostly work at least with YouTube and Twitch.

## Installation
Place [this][build] in your mpv `scripts` folder. By default, the script is activated by the W (shift+w) key.

## Usage
Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Building (development)
Building requires [`moonc`, the MoonScript compiler][moonscript], added to the PATH, and a GNU Make-compatible make. Run `make` on the root directory. The output files will be placed under the `build` directory.
